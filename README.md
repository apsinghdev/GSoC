I applied for the GSoC'24 and got rejected but fortunately I was selected in the same organization from DMP'24 ( a programm same like GSoC ).

Some of my frineds were asking me about How was my journey, how I wrote the proposal etc. So I am providing the link to my proposal below and
will share the things I learnt by contributing in Open Source Project in near future.
