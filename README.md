I applied for the GSoC'24 and got rejected but fortunately, I was selected for the same organization as DMP'24 ( a program similar to GSoC ).

Some of my friends were asking me about my journey, how I wrote the proposal etc. So I am providing the link to my proposal below and
will share the things I learned by contributing to Open Source Projects shortly.
